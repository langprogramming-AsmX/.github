# AsmX - organization for the development of the AsmX programming language

Welcome to the AsmX organization! We are developing and supporting a new modern programming language called AsmX. Our goal is to create a simple, efficient and high-performance programming language that can be used for various tasks.

## How to contribute

We welcome contributions from the developer community. However, to maintain code quality and project consistency, we accept Pull Request (PR) only with the consent of our developers. Before submitting a PR, please review our respective code style guides and conventions for making changes.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation on AsmX can be found on our website: AsmX Documentation. Here you will find all the necessary instructions, code examples, guides for using the language and its libraries.

## AsmX Standard

The AsmX standard is the main document describing the programming language. The full text of the standard is available in our GitHub repository: AsmX Standard.
